### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on a new unqualified lookup implementation for the Swift compiler. This is part of `SwiftLexicalLookup`, a library within the [`swift-syntax`](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax) package, which I initially developed during Google Summer of Code 2024.
